# Project 12: Inventory System

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 12 for the MHS Software Engineering class. The focus of this project is to introduce students to advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through a series of labs that build towards a comprehensive Inventory Management System.

## Main Project: Lab Exercises
- Lab 1: [`lab1.py`](lab1.py) - This lab introduces basic OOP concepts by creating a class named `Item` that represents a generic item in an inventory system. Students implement encapsulation using private attributes and public getters and setters, laying the foundation for data integrity and encapsulation principles.
- Lab 2: [`lab2.py`](lab2.py) - Students extend the functionality developed in Lab 1 by creating an `InventoryManager` class that acts as a facade for managing an inventory of items. This lab demonstrates the use of encapsulation and the facade design pattern, enhancing the students' understanding of designing clean and manageable interfaces.
- Lab 3: [`lab3.py`](lab3.py) - This lab builds upon the previous labs by developing a user interface for the Inventory Management System. Students will create a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the `InventoryManager` to add, update, remove, and view items in the inventory, integrating all learned concepts into a working application.

## Extension Task
As an extension task, students are encouraged to expand their inventory management system by incorporating features such as:
- Saving and loading inventory state to and from a file.
- Implementing additional features like sorting, searching, and categorizing items.
- Enhancing user interaction with more robust error handling and user feedback.

## Learning Outcomes
- Apply encapsulation and the facade design pattern to manage and simplify complex system interactions.
- Create a user-friendly command-line interface that integrates with backend systems to perform CRUD operations.
- Develop the ability to troubleshoot and enhance existing code to improve functionality and user experience.
